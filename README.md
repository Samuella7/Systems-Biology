Model Progression of a Pathogen Samuella EBENY_Assignment
This code covers the progression of a pathogen and inflammation in different scenarios, including fitting the model to the American population data and exploring various cases of inflammatory response dynamics.


Second project:Blood glucose regulation Model Samuella EBENY assignment
The objective of this project is to formulate a model for blood glucose regulation subsequent to the ingestion of a glucose bolus in mice. Initially, we will construct the model based on calibration data, followed by its application to pathological data in an endeavor to discern disparities between two distinct conditions.
